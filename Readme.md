*ChessClock* is a somewhat ambitious project to make an elaborate Chess clock base on *Raspberry Pi*, and a relatively large screen.

There are many ideas about [Features](../../wiki/Features) that may never see the light of day.

This image is is a conceptual render of the final product. It only shows relative sizes of each major component (body, screen, rocker), but you get the idea:

## Ingredients
* [Hardware](../../wiki/Hardware)
* 3d Printed body with custom rocker switch
* [Software](Software). 
  * The app is based on a purpose-built but general system, [Gambit](Gambit).
  * The main source tree is in [ChessClock](ChessClock).
* Art

## Wiki

There is a developing [Wiki](../../wiki/Home) in progress.

## Jira

There's a [Jira board](https://chessclock.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&selectedIssue=CHES-3) to keep track of things.

## Chess Clock Body

The body is self-contained and runs off a LiPo battery. A means to readily pull apart the shell, to turn the device on and off, and to change the battery are all required.

### Rocker

This is a key component of the project. If this doesn't feel/work well, the project fails.

#### Switches

Want micro-switch at the end of travel:

## Connecting ADB

```bash
$ adb connect ip-address:5555 # find the ip-address on Pi/About settings
```

## Art

Various art assets will be required, such as:

* Fonts
* Backgrounds
* Animations
* Transitions
* Sound Effects

## Future Work

* Android Connectivity via Bluetooth
* [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api)
