# Features
Here're some ideas on what can be done with this clock:

## Key Features
* Use it as a basic functional Chess Clock with a satisfying rocker control.
  * Show time remaining for each player (including milliseconds)
  * Key to the entire project.
* Have an easy to use interface for setting time controls, including presets.
* Control the timer (including shared presets) from an Android Phone.
* Touch screen can be used for various functionality.
* Display extra information like match history etc.
* Show millisecond accuracy.
## Nice to have
* Premoves
  * Will require a third rocker position.
* Exploit [Lichess](wwww.lichess.org) API for Avatars and player ranking.
* Show Rule34 videos in-between games.
  * Or just Agadmator.
* Replay games with visuals.
* Undo moves (with time adjustments). For plebs only.
* Speaker for Start/End game, minute reminders, and last 10-second countdown.
  * Custom sound effects
## Stretch Goals
* Game analysis with *StockFish* at any time
  * Will require image recognition addition with camera and NN training.
